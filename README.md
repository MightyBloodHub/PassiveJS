# PassiveJS

PassiveJS is an open-source boilerplate designed for creating passive display applications, such as digital signage, informational screens, and other non-interactive content delivery systems. The primary goal of PassiveJS is to provide developers with a simple, out-of-the-box solution that automatically handles scaling, ensures content fits perfectly on any screen, and eliminates the need for user interaction.

## The Vision

PassiveJS aims to fill a niche in the web development community by focusing on the creation of non-interactive applications that require minimal setup and maintenance. Unlike traditional web frameworks that prioritize user interaction, PassiveJS is built with the assumption that content will be passively consumed. This makes it ideal for environments where information needs to be displayed clearly and attractively, without requiring any user input.

### Key Features

- Auto-Scaling Layout: Automatically adjusts content to fit any screen size without scrolling or manual adjustments.
- Non-Interactive Design: Perfect for use cases where user interaction is unnecessary or undesirable.
- Built-In Slideshow Functionality: Easily create engaging, automated slideshows with customizable transitions.
- Simple Configuration: A `settings.json` file allows for easy customization of key parameters like screen dimensions and slideshow intervals.
- Modular Components: Ready-to-use components for common display elements, such as headers, footers, and media galleries.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MightyBloodHub/PassiveJS.git
   cd PassiveJS

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MightyBloodHub/PassiveJS.git
   cd PassiveJS
   ```

2. Customize Your Display:
   - Modify `index.html` and `css/styles.css` to match your design requirements.
   - Use `js/components/` to add or customize JavaScript components.

3. Configure Settings:
   - Adjust the `config/settings.json` file to set your preferred screen size, scaling options, and slideshow intervals.

4. Run Your Display:
   - Open `index.html` in your preferred browser to view your passive display in action.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Boilerplate Development (Current)
- Initial Release: Create the foundational structure, including auto-scaling, basic components, and slideshow functionality.
- Documentation: Provide detailed instructions and examples for using PassiveJS.

### Phase 2: Expansion and Modularization
- Component Library: Develop a more extensive library of modular components (e.g., video players, data-driven charts, weather widgets).
- Themes and Styles: Introduce a theming system to easily switch between different visual styles.
- Advanced Animations: Expand on transition effects and animations, adding more customization options.

### Phase 3: Framework Evolution
- Configuration Enhancements: Implement more advanced configuration options, possibly introducing a GUI for non-technical users.
- Plugin System: Allow for third-party plugins or extensions to integrate seamlessly with PassiveJS.
- Community Engagement: Foster a community around PassiveJS, encouraging contributions, feedback, and collaborative development.

### Phase 4: Rebranding to Framework
- Rebranding: As the feature set expands, rebrand PassiveJS from a boilerplate to a full-fledged framework.
- Ecosystem Development: Build out a comprehensive ecosystem with detailed documentation, a dedicated website, and community support forums.
